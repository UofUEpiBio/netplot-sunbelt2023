This webpage will explore the dataset exploring connections in 7th and 8th grade students at a middle school. The data was taken from ["Estimates of Social Contact in a Middle School Based on Self-Report and Wireless Sensor Data"](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153690). This is the "Example 1" on the poster.
